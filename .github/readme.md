# Bug.NET (special GitHub repository)

Hello!

This repository is used as a special directory on GitHub, it enables some
special features for Bug.NET such as shared issue templates, default
community files *(like our code of conduct, etc)*, and more.

We have to keep this repository public so that all of the special features
GitHub provides will work, but it is not meant to be used by the public
directly, so please don't create any issues or bug reports here.

If you'd like to see an overview of our current projects, and the repositories
that the public is meant to interact with, then please take a look at our
[Bug.NET GitHub profile](https://github.com/BugDotNet#current-projects).
