# Governance

This guide will explain how the structure of the Bug.NET organisation, and how
decisions will be made.


## Structure

The Bug.NET organisation will follow a simple
"[benevolent dictator for life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)"
structure, with [Nightowl](https://github.com/nightowl286) at the helm.

### Benevolent dictator for life

[Nightowl](https://github.com/nightowl286) *(as the creator of
[OwlDomain](https://github.com/owl-domain)
and
[Bug.NET](https://github.com/bugdotnet))*, will lead the Bug.NET project as a
"[benevolent dictator for life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)",
meaning that they will have the final say about all project decisions and
disputes. They will also do their best to read and consider every suggestion and
opinion that is left over at the
[Bug.NET discussion](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions)
area.

*"Benevolent dictator for life" may be abbreviated as BDFL for brevity.*

### Organisation members

Organisation members, are GitHub *(and sometimes not GitHub specific)* members
that are either officially added to the Bug.NET organisation *(which can be
seen by viewing the
[organisation members](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/people) page)*, or
people that are considered to be a part of the organisation by the
[BDFL](#benevolent-dictator-for-life).

*No unique responsibilities as of yet.*

### Project members

Project members, are GitHub *(and sometimes not GitHub specific)* members
that are either officially added to a specific Bug.NET project, or people
that are considered to be a part of the project by the
[BDFL](#benevolent-dictator-for-life).

*No unique responsibilities as of yet.*

### Maintainers

The term "maintainers" is a catch-all phrase that's used to refer to the
[BDFL](#benevolent-dictator-for-life), and to the
[organisation](#organisation-members) /
[project](#project-members) members.

Everyone participating and interacting with the Bug.NET projects and the Bug.NET
community must follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/BugDotNet/.github/blob/main/.github/code_of_conduct.md).
**This includes all of the maintainers.** As such please don't be afraid to
bring it up if you think a maintainer is conducting themselves inappropriately,
even if it's the [BDFL](#benevolent-dictator-for-life).

### Moderators

Moderators are members of the Bug.NET organisation that have been given the
permission to moderate the content that is available through the Bug.NET
projects or through the Bug.NET community.

*Currently the only moderator is the [BDFL](#benevolent-dictator-for-life).*

### Contributors

A contributor is anyone that helps out with the Bug.NET projects, or with the
community, whether that's through
[submitting code](https://github.com/BugDotNet/.github/blob/main/.github/contributing.md#code-contributions),
or
[helping out with research](https://github.com/BugDotNet/.github/blob/main/.github/contributing.md#research),
or through any other way that's outlined in our
[contributing guide](https://github.com/BugDotNet/.github/blob/main/.github/contributing.md#ways-to-help-out).

Regular contributors may eventually be invited to become maintainers, this
will be decided by the [BDFL](#benevolent-dictator-for-life), but the other
maintainers can make suggestions and recommendations.


## Decisions

Currently, all decisions are finalised by the
[BDFL](#benevolent-dictator-for-life).


## Updates

Currently, the Bug.NET project is too small to warrant any other official roles
or set decision-making processes, however that may change in the future, if it
does then this document will also be updated, and any significant changes will
be mentioned in the
[announcement discussion](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/announcements)
area.
