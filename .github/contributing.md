# Contributing

Unlike most OwlDomain projects, Bug.NET will be under an
[MIT license](https://github.com/BugDotNet/.github/blob/main/license.md),
and it will accept community contributions. However at this stage of the
project, code contributions will not be accepted yet, but you can still help out
in other ways, if you'd like to learn more about that then please continue
reading this guide.

If you'd like to create a new issue, whether for a question, a bug report, or a
feature request *(or anything else)*, then please read the
[issues section](#issues) *(the next section)* of this guide first.


***As always, when interacting with the Bug.NET community, please remember
to adhere to our
[code of conduct](https://github.com/BugDotNet/.github/blob/main/.github/code_of_conduct.md),
it is there to ensure that the Bug.NET community stays as a welcoming place,
that focuses on the technology, and the project that it's responsible for.***


## Issues

If you want to report a bug, then first please look at the existing bug reports
for the project you have an issue with to see if your issue has already been
reported, and if it hasn't then please create a new bug report issue using
one of the available templates.

If you're having trouble figuring out which project to look at, check out the
overview of our projects on the main
[Bug.NET GitHub profile](https://github.com/BugDotNet#current-projects).

For anything other than bug reports *(such as: new feature suggestions; Q&amp;A;
showing off your projects; etc)*, please use the
[discussions](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions?discussions_q=)
feature of GitHub and the relevant categories.


## Quality

Even though contributions from the community are welcome, this is still
primarily an OwlDomain project, and as such it will be held to the same amount
of standard as I'd expect for any OwlDomain project.

This means that, in short, we will be prioritising user experience and the
polish of the final product over the difficulty or time it may take to create a
new feature or fix a bug. *(You can read about the purpose and backstory of
OwlDomain on our [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Owl-Domain)).*


## Ways to help out

Even though this project is primarily centred around .NET *(and more
specifically around C#)*, there are lots of ways you can help out, and quite
a few of those ways won't even require you to write any C# code.

### Feedback

You can contribute to the project simply by trying it out *(either directly,
or through tools that make use of it)*, and giving us your feedback over in the
[feedback discussion](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/feedback)
area.

We want to create a product that's worthy of being a true competitor, hence
all of your feedback is important, whether there's something you really like,
or something you really hate, or even things that mildly irritate you, and even
the things that you don't care about, hearing about it all is important for us
to know what areas of the project we need to polish more.

### Sharing your ideas

Over at the
[idea discussion](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/ideas)
area, you can give us your ideas for new features or tools that we could
implement/create, or any changes you think would help improve Bug.NET.

Even if you're not sure how *(or if)* it's something we could feasibly create,
your ideas can still be discussed, and they may even inspire new ideas in
others.

### Helping others

There's a [Q&A discussion](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/q-a)
area where people can ask questions regarding Bug.NET, and you can help them by
answering their questions.

*(Although the hope is that everything should be documented enough that
this won't be needed - but alas, no one is perfect)*.

### Code contributions

Code contributions are not *currently* being accepted, this is because Bug.NET
is still in its initial stages, and I still need to figure out exactly what I
should do to legally protect it.

However if you'd like to prepare for when code contributions will be accepted,
then keep in mind that all commits made to Bug.NET will have to be
[signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits),
and any pull requests should target the `develop` branch of the project, instead
of the `main` branch.

### Research

Bug.NET contains a lot of different areas, and as such there is a lot of
research that has to be done beforehand to ensure that everything is working
as expected, and to its highest standard.

Research tasks come in different shapes and sizes:

- Some will require you to experiment with code, sometimes C#, sometimes
  something else.
- Some will involve understanding theory and maths, and then summarising it.
- Some will involve exploring the different technologies available, such as
  new protocols to support, new tooling types, or new integrations.
- Some will require you to take a look at the past attempts of other people to
  see where they have failed, so that we can learn from their mistakes.

If you'd like to see what research tasks we'd like to focus on at the present,
then take a look at the
[open research tasks](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/projects/3/views/4),
and if none of them fit your
interests then feel free to research things on your own, and discuss it over
at the [research discussion](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/research)
area.

Don't worry if you think someone is already doing the research that you've
wanted to do, more research is always better, and you might even be able to find
parts that they couldn't *(and vice versa)*. if you're proactive about leaving
updates *(in the discussion area)* about how your research is going, then you
might even get a chance to communicate, join up, and research the topic as a
team.

### Integration

Since this project only contains a collection of IDE tools, most of them
probably won't be used by other people directly, and for us to truly be a rival
we'd need to ensure that the end workflow for the actual users is as smooth as
possible.

In order to achieve that at the start, we'd need more integrations with
the different general editors that people like to use, and it would be very
unlikely for us to support them all, not just because of the sheer amount of
work that would be necessary, but because the best extensions and plugins come
from understanding the workflows and preferences of the people using those
editors, and as such, a copy pasted extension made to "just work" would result
in quite a lacklustre experience for the end developers.

If you make use of Bug.NET in something that you have made, then please
show it off at the
[show and tell discussion](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)
area.


## Updates

Any significant changes to this guide will be mentioned in the
[announcement discussion](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/announcements)
area.
