# Code of conduct

By contributing to the Bug.NET projects, or by interacting with our community
you agree to follow this code of conduct, which exists to ensure that the
Bug.NET community stays as a welcoming place, that focuses on the technology,
and the project that it's responsible for.

Everything in this guide is **in addition** to
[GitHub's acceptable use policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies).

This code of conduct must be followed by anyone contributing to the Bug.NET
projects, or interacting with our community. **This includes all of the
[maintainers](https://github.com/BugDotNet/.github/blob/main/.github/governance.md#maintainers)**.
If you see something you think is harmful then please mention or report it -
depending on the severity.


## Communication

Communication is hard, especially in a textual form over the internet, even more
so when it's compounded by language and cultural barriers, as such it can be
difficult to understand each other properly, and unintentional arguments can
happen, as such, there are some simple rules to follow so that we can avoid most
of the unnecessary arguments that occur from miscommunication.

### Everyone makes mistakes

Everyone makes mistakes. Sometimes people misread things, or use the wrong word,
or phrase things in a way that doesn't get their point across clearly, and the
people they are speaking with *(or the people that are simply reading the
conversation later on and not interacting with it)* can end up getting the wrong
idea, or taking things the wrong way.

This also includes you. You are also a human being *(probably)*, and as such
you will also make these mistakes from time to time, and that's OK. The key is
in recognising them, and noticing that you've made a mistake, and then
correcting it.

### Acronyms

Not everyone that makes an issue or engages in a discussion *(or reads it
afterwards)* will know about all of the acronyms that we commonly use, even the
acronyms that are associated with the project that the discussion is about.

There are plenty of ways people could end up in a project discussion, without
being familiar with the technical side of the project, and not all acronyms are
easy to look up and figure out.

As such, acronyms should either be avoided, *(however they do certainly make
things more terse)* or they should be explained at least once per the
issue/discussion. A simple link, or the full name of the acronym would be fine:

> The Bug.NET debugger implements the
> [DAP](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/).

Or:
> The Bug.NET debugger implements the "Debug Adapter Protocol" (DAP).

Or both:
> The Bug.NET debugger implements the "Debug Adapter Protocol"
> ([DAP](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/)).


If you are going to be using an acronym, then please try to make sure it's
explained somewhere near the top of the issue/discussions, as GitHub will
sometimes collapse the middle area making it more difficult to find the
explanation. Of course this isn't always going to be practical or possible
*(such as when the acronym is only relevant later on in the conversation)*,
but please still keep it in mind.

*There may at some point be an acronym definition guide for Bug.NET, but
that will only be created once/if it's actually needed.*

### Expressions

Quite often people will end up using common sayings *(proverbs/idioms/etc.)*
when in a conversation, however these *do not* always have equivalents in other
languages and cultures, and they end up being confusing to the people reading
them, an example of this would be the common *(to me)* saying of:

> Tell me about it.

Read as an idiom, it means that someone is agreeing/relating with what you're
saying. But read literally, it sounds like someone asking for more information
or an explanation.

As such, expressions like this should be avoided, but if you really want to use
them then you should provide a link/explanation for them as well.

### Numbers

Not every culture agrees on how numbers are formatted, for example some places
use the comma (`,`) as a
[thousand separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator#Digit_grouping),
however others will use the period (`.`) instead. The same problem occurs with
the decimal separator.

As such, during regular conversations you should either avoid bigger numbers, or
round them and use the common suffixes like `k` for thousand, `m` for million,
and `b` for billion.

If the number needs to be more specific, or you're
discussing maths or code then you should write the numbers in a
[code block](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code)
and use an underscore (`_`) as a thousand separator, and a period (`.`) as a
decimal separator since this is the most common notation seen in code,
especially in C# which will be the primary language used in the Bug.NET
projects.

### Winning isn't everything

In my experience with the internet *(and with people)*, I've seen a lot of
pointless arguments and fallouts happen simply because people are desperate to
make sure that their "side" wins an argument, whether because of pride or
stubbornness, or something else entirely.

Winning an argument or a debate should ***never*** be your priority, reaching
the correct answer is what you should be focusing on. Sometimes you might be
right about something, but sometimes you might be completely and utterly wrong
about something, and this is what you should assume.

Assume that you are in the wrong and whoever you're debating is in the right,
and then try to see if you can prove to yourself that you are in fact correct.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with admitting you were wrong, it is a sign
of learning and progress, especially if you're in a position of power *(such as
being a maintainer on the project).*

### Sometimes there isn't a winner

Not every debate will have a reasonable conclusion, sometimes both "sides" may
be wrong, quite often *(but not always)* the extreme views will be wrong, and
instead a little bit of both "sides" will be right about different things, and
a compromise is the correct solution.


## Patience

Miscommunication will still happen even if you try your best to be clear about
everything, and as such we should all be patient with one another, both when
we're communicating, and when we're waiting for an answer.


## Exceptions

Even though patience should be shown, the
[moderators](https://github.com/BugDotNet/.github/blob/main/.github/governance.md#moderators)
reserve the right to deal with any obvious trolls or harmful participants.


## Updates

Any significant changes to this guide will be mentioned in the
[announcement discussion](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/announcements)
area.
