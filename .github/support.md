# Support

First of all, we're sorry to hear that you're having trouble with one of our
projects, it is our intention to document and test everything properly so that
this doesn't happen.

If there is something in our documentation that wasn't clear, or something that
confused you, then we'd like to ask you to please leave your feedback over at
the
[Bug.NET discussion area](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/feedback)
so that we can work on improving it, and make sure that no one else ends up
with the same problem as you.

## General questions

If you've already double-checked that the documentation is missing something
that you need, then the next place to check would be the
[Q&A discussion area](hhttps://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=)
to see if anyone else before you has ran into the same problem before we've had
a chance to fix it.

You can also use this Q&A area to ask your own questions, whether because you're
confused or wondering about something and you don't think it's a bug. *The
[Bug.NET discussion area](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/feedback)
also contains a lot more things that you might find interesting.*


## Bug reports

If checking the discussion area fails, or you're positive that you have
encountered a bug, then please report it as an issue in the relevant repository.
You can see an overview of our projects on the main
[Bug.NET GitHub profile](https://github.com/BugDotNet#current-projects),
which should help you figure out which repository you need.

If you're still not sure which repository to create the bug report in, then
please ask a question in the
[Q&A discussion area](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/new?category=q-a),
as we use one GitHub discussion forum for the entire Bug.NET organisation
meaning that it is project agnostic.


## New ideas / improvements

If you have some ideas on how we could improve one of our projects, or how we
could document/organise things better, then please bring it up over at the
[idea discussion area](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/ideas?discussions_q=) *(after checking if someone else has already brought up
this idea).*

If something has annoyed you, but you're not sure how we could improve it, then
please leave some feedback for us over at the
[feedback discussion area](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/feedback?discussions_q=),
and we will take it into consideration when planning out the improvements to our
organisation.


## Nothing helped

In the *(hopefully)* unlikely event that none of these suggestions have helped
you, then we urge you to please leave your feedback over at the
[Bug.NET discussion area](https://github.com/orgs/BugDotNet/discussions/categories/feedback),
as this situation should hopefully never happen.
